# Video Recorder

## Summary

Sample SharePoint Framework client-side web part illustrating Video Recording using [MediaRecorder Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder). 

This is an experimental web part. Because this technology's specification has not stabilized, check the compatibility table for usage in various browsers. Also note that the syntax and behavior of an experimental technology is subject to change in future versions of browsers as the specification changes
